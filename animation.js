They are teachers, crusaders, and advocates for change: always striving to improve things, but afraid of making a mistake. Well-organized, orderly, and fastidious, they try to maintain high standards, but can slip into being critical and perfectionistic. They typically have problems with resentment and impatience. At their best: wise, discerning, realistic, and noble. Can be morally heroic."],

Pride will cause them to want to resist being served by others. But Jesus solemnly warns Peter that if he doesn’t humble himself and admit his weakness and neediness, then he cannot have a relationship with Jesus. For Jesus came to serve, not to be served.",

They are well-meaning and driven to be close to others, but can slip into doing things for others in order to be needed. They typically have problems with possessiveness and with acknowledging their own needs. At their Best: unselfish and altruistic, they have unconditional love for others."],

Without the core motivation of love, Paul says our efforts are but a noisy gong or clanging cymbal. In other words, we are only seeking to draw attention to ourselves and impress. When ambition and accomplishments are the ultimate goal, love is never present.",

The 'these things' that Jesus is referring to are unpacked in John 15:1-10, the essence of which is summed up when He says, 'Abide in me, and I in you' (15:4). Jesus is describing the glorious reality of the mutual indwelling of God and man through faith in the gospel. This is uniquely meaningful for a Four in that it reassures them that nothing is missing.

Withholding themselves from others due to feeling vulnerable and defective, they can also feel disdainful and exempt from ordinary ways of living. They typically have problems with melancholy, self-indulgence, and self-pity. At their Best: inspired and highly creative, they are able to renew themselves and transform their experiences."],

Independent, innovative, and inventive, they can also become preoccupied with their thoughts and imaginary constructs. They become detached, yet high-strung and intense.

                "1 Peter 5:6-7. Sixes will have their fear transformed into courage and confidence as they humble themselves before God and cast their anxieties on Him. The most important thing for Sixes to remember is that they are safe to come to God with their fears because 'He cares for them.' Sixes can rest and act courageously because they have a God who promises to take care of them. When they doubt this truth, they need only to look at the cross to see the extent of God’s loving care.",

Excellent 'troubleshooters,' they foresee problems and foster cooperation, but can also become defensive, evasive, and anxious—running on stress while complaining about it.

At their Best: internally stable and self-reliant, courageously championing themselves and others."],

Playful, high-spirited, and practical, they can also misapply their many talents, becoming over-extended, scattered, and undisciplined. They constantly seek new and exciting experiences, but can become distracted and exhausted by staying on the go. They typically have problems with impatience and impulsiveness. At their Best: they focus their talents on worthwhile goals, becoming appreciative, joyous, and satisfied."],

Therefore, they must learn to trust their intuition, assert their presence, and exercise their voice. This is what Paul is exhorting us to do in this verse. The body of Christ will not grow into the fullness of Christ apart from the boldness to speak the truth in love. Nines are good with the 'in love' part. It’s lacking the courage and clarity to speak the truth that they struggle with. The world needs their objectivity and voice, for they have unique ability to harmonize and restore peace. So in faith they must learn to be bold and declare the truth in love.",

They want everything to go smoothly and be without conflict, but they can also tend to be complacent, simplifying problems and minimizing anything upsetting. They typically have problems with inertia and stubbornness. At their Best: indomitable and all-embracing, they are able to bring people together and heal conflicts."]
