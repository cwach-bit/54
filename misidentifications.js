In other words, they feel there is no free lunch and put a significant amount of pressure on themselves to measure up. The Compliant types are also the types most disconnected from the Mind Center. This does not mean they're less intelligent than other types, but rather that they have the most difficulty connecting with their internal guidance. These types are prone to substituting opinions, conventional wisdom and static ideas from past experience for the dynamic inner knowing that comes from being in touch with the Mind Center.",
                            "Withdrawn": "People whose dominant Social Style is the withdrawn style perceive a distinct sense of the self being small, weak or vulnerable and easily overwhelmed by the world. They feel a need to shut out external influences before their needs can be met. The Withdrawn types are also the types most disconnected from the Body Center. This does not mean they are weaker or less concerned about their autonomy than other types, but rather that they have the most difficulty connecting with their sense of wholeness and vitality. These types are prone to substituting dissociation, resistance and avoidance for the sense of realness, strength and groundedness that comes from being in touch with the Body Center.",
                            "Assertive": "People whose dominant Social Style is the assertive style see the world as offering up what they need and their personal philosophy tends to be that the best things come to those who actively go after them.

This does not mean they're less sensitive or empathetic than other types, but rather that they tend to avoid awareness of their own vulnerability.

                            "Positive Outlook": "People whose dominant Harmonic approach is the Positive Outlook approach are generally optimistic and tend to avoid negative thoughts or situations. Under stress, they seek to avoid the problem, distract themselves with something else, or minimize the problem. These types want to feel good and want others around them feel good. They would rather have everyone happy (including themselves) than to deal with problems or negativity (especially in themselves). Unfortunately this approach can lead them to deny the existence of their problems and therefore delay addressing them.",
                            "Competent": "People whose dominant Harmonic approach is the Competency approach try solving problems in an objective, unemotional manner. Unlike people of the reactive approach, they don't get worked up when problems happen, they remain cool and emotionally detached from them.",
                            "Reactive": "People whose dominant Harmonic approach is the Reactive approach are emotionally reactive under stress. They tend to work themselves up when a problem happens and have a hard time containing their feelings. This emotional intensity allows them to feel the 'realness' of the problem, even if it is a relatively small one. Venting their frustration allows them to move on to dealing with the issue. Wanting others to see the realness of the problem, they expect others to react emotionally. Such a reaction would confirm that others agree that indeed this is a big deal. If others don't respond in the way the Reactive approach types want, they may become even more frustrated and emotional.",

However, once they find the source of their happiness, they tend to become disappointed and disillusioned with it. As a result, they become frustrated as they begin their search again. Their sense of self is based on the search for an ideal. These types need to remember that they can find contentment by accepting their present experience.",
                            "Rejection": "People with the rejection object relation feel that they have been rejected by others. Others don't care about their needs, so they reject their own needs too. Consequently, their relationships often have issues of not wanting to be nurtured or touched. Despite feeling rejected, they feel they only have one gift to offer to prevent future rejection. Their sense of self is based on countering this rejection by offering their talent.",
